<description>A collection of changes and options to make mortar accuracy better/worse, instead of having a fixed spread radius of 13 tiles.

-Accuracy is affected by a colonist's Intellectual and/or Shooting skills
-Accuracy is affected by weather and time of day
-Automatically lead moving targets
-The miss chance caused by targets being in cover is removed

This affects all mortar shots, including enemy mortars.

Supports other mods:
In general, any modded mortars are supported. (Technical: any building that uses the Verb_Shoot and doesn't require line of sight is affected)
Verified functionality: [WD] Expanded Artillery, More Vanilla Turrets, Kaiser Armory

Load order does not matter to affect either of these mods.
